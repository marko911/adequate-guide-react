# React using Mostly Adequate Guide concepts

This was created as an attempt to use the concepts, data structures,
and libraries from [Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming ](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide) in a real world react app.

The app is a podcast and audiobooks feed creator. Search returns results for audiobooks and podcasts. Save will save them to localstorage as subscriptions. In the Dashboard, each podcast's feed is fetched and consolidated into a single list.

## Available Scripts

Install:

### `npm install`

run app:

### `npm start`
